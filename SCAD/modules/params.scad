/*

Values in `camelCase` are user-variable (within reason); 
values like numNeedles and screwDiam, etc.,  can be modified to
accommodate user preference or hardware subsitution. 

Values in `ALL_CAPS` should be considered CONSTANTS and should
only be modified with *extreme caution* as they will affect the 
relationship between the needles and the cams, which could
prevent stitches from forming correctly.

I recommend only modifying these constants if you are also 
making changes to the cam design in the technical sketch.
